# Athlete-Lab
Collection of work completed throughout Athlete Lab course

This course was created by Collin Murray to help individuals looking to break into a career in sports, namely baseball. Collin has provided a foundation for those new to R and provided templates for various analytics tools useful for baseball coaches & players. Within those templates, there are opportunities for the student (myself) to edit/manipulate the template & data to inspire my own creations that will allow me to build a portfolio.
